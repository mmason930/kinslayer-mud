				What is a SuperMOB?
			</h1>
			
		     <p>When it comes to defining what a <span class="bold">SuperMOB</span> is, a new player must first understand what a <span class="bold">MOB</span> is.</p>
		     <br />
		     <h2>What is a mob?</h2>
		     <p>Mob is short for "mobile".This is essentially a computer generated character for the purpose of allowing players to interact with the game.
		     These mobs wander around the world performing various tasks, and can provide players with experience points, equipment, and/or answers to riddles.</p>
		     <br />
		     <h2>So what is a SuperMOB then?</h2>
		     <p>A SuperMOB can be considered a mob on steroids. It often has special abilities that normal mobs do not have that make them hard to kill.
		     Along with their special abilities they often wear the best equipment.</p>
		
		     <p>A SuperMOB is characterized by being difficult to take down individually, however they often may have many followers with them. These are
		     often referred to as "minions". In many cases these followers must be taken down before being able to finish off the SuperMOB himself.
		     <br /> <br /> A list of SuperMOBs can be found on our "<span class="bold"><a href="./supermob_listing">SuperMOB Listing</a></span></span>" feature. This list also shows what type of equipment each SuperMOB may have, and
		     in what area of the world they can be found. Be warned that some SuperMOBs may be considered innocent, especially when playing the Human race. Some may be considered leaders
		     of player factions and may not be wise to kill.
