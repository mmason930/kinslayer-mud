				Introduction to Mining
			</h1>
			
			<p>
				One of the many features of KinslayerMUD is the ability to mine and collect different types of metals from mines located all
				over the Kinslayer world. The types of metals that can be mined depend on the type of mine. These metals can be brought to a
				furnace in certain cities in order to smith various high quality weapons (discussed in
				the <span class="bold"><a href="./introduction-to-smithing">Smithing</a></span> guides). Two separate guides are provided on
				the left depending on the race of interest: Human or Shadow.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h2>Mining as a Human</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="bold">Required: a mining pick</span><br/>
				Mining picks can be purchased from supply stores or other shops in human cities across the world.
				For example in Caemlyn at the "Caemlyn Supplies" shop (found north, west, west, north, and east (n, 2w, n, e) from the Caemlyn Plaza).
				To purchase a pick simply [type] "buy pick". </p>
				<p><span class="bold">Finding a Mine</span> <br />
				There are different sorts of mines that have been discovered in the Kinslayer World.
				Some of these mines are in dangerous territory and due to this rarer metals can be found more frequently.
				Other mines which are closer to home still have some of these rarer metals but they are not as readily found.
				A good mine suited to start ones mining career is near the city of Bearlon.The city of Bearlon is located far west of Caemlyn.
				Finding it is simply a matter of traveling west from the western gates of Caemlyn.
				To get a better idea please consult the "map section".
				Once in Bearlon the mine can be found by going east, south, south, and east (e, 2s, e).
				The mine has not been fully uncovered to allow for a proper entry. One must [type] "crawl entrance" to gain access.</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Mining in a Mine</span>  <br />
				Once inside the mine heading east and south from the mine's entrance will lead to a mining area.
				Once there one should firstly ensure that their mining pick is wielded, just like they would a weapon, and then they can [type] "mine" to start mining.</p>
				<p><span class="bold">What's next?</span> <br />
				Mining will produce many different types of ores ranging from coal, tin, copper, aluminum, iron, silver, gold, platinum, and obsidian.
				These in turn can either be sold to at an ore merchant shop (one of these can be found on the western side of Bearlon), or they can be smelted into bars to fashion special weapons at certain blacksmiths.
				A guide to smelting ore and further use can be found on the left hand side, or by clicking here.</p>
				<p>Prices for specific ores which can be sold at the ore merchant shop in the Bearlon (found south, south, south, west, west, north, west, west, south, west, west, north, west, west, west, west, west, west, west, south, south, west, north, north, north, and east (3s 2w,n, 2w, s, 2w, n, 7w, 2s, w, 3n, e) of Bearlon's east gate) are listed below:</p>
