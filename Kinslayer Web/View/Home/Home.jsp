					KinslayerMUD.org began in 2002, and we've come a long way since then. We've created a battle system that locks our two races and integrates
					our five different classes in a continuous struggle for land, status, power, and wealth. The best part? You can never truly be defeated. Once a player is killed, they can always re-spawn and re-join the fray.
					This allows for comraderie and nemeses that continues without having to lose everything you previously gained. As your character's status increases, he/she can sometimes change into a more powerful creature.
					Ordinary characters can gain character perks through the clans they join, as they progress they can achieve ranking bonuses, and if they become powerful enough they can receive character upgrades.
					Humans can become blademasters, trollocs can become Myrddraals (or fades), and dreadguards can become dreadlords. With players logging in to KinslayerMUD.org from all over the world, this game presents all of the elements
					that people want from a game; challenge, a social atmosphere, many player areas, character achievement, as well as diverse classes, skills, and equipment.

					<a href="./new-to-muds"><b>Never played a M.U.D before?</b></a>
					<br />
					M.U.D stands for Multi-User Dungeon. M.U.D's are special types of games that allow many players to connect from all around the world to interact through roleplay, or through
					in-game battle using basic telnet technology, and at <b style="color: #003B6E;">no cost</b>. <b style="color: #003B6E;">No game subscriptions or software purchases required.</b>
					First time players, however, normally need to get used to some basic game commands to be competitive. If you are a first time player, you may want to consult our
					<a href="./new-to-muds"> learning how to play</a> guide before entering the game.<br />

					<a href="./getting-started"><b>Played a MUD before?</b></a><br />
					Learning a new MUD is often not so much of a task if one has already played a MUD before. However, some basic knowledge
					such as knowing how to eat, drink, attack, defend, as well as character classes and various types equipment can differ from one game to the next. This is why we have a Game Handbook
					to help you get past that initial learning curve so you can learn how to play our game more quickly. <a href="./getting-started">Click here to continue..</a>
