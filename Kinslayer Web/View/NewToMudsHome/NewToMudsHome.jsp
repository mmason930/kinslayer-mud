				What is a MUD?
			</h1>
			
			<p>
				A MUD is a Multi-User Dungeon, a real-time multiplayer virtual world, usually in the form of text. They are the predecessors to current-day MMORPGs,
				originating in the 1970s before flourishing in the 1990s. Despite a diverse selection of more modern games, many MUDs remain operational to this day.
				The world is divided into a series of rooms that players can travel between, and within which players and <a href="/wiki/index.php/NPC">NPCs</a> can interact.

			<p>
				MUDs typically cater to a variety of playstyles, ranging from the `explorers` who strives to discover the secrets of the world, the `roleplayers`

				Introduction to MUDs
			</h1>
			<p>
				<strong>
					MUDs have somewhat of a learning curve, but once the basics are mastered they can be much more dynamic and more player oriented than other types of games.
					The first thing to learn is how to travel about within the KinslayerMUD world. Gaining experience, levels, and equipment are the next challenges, and beyond that
					at the highest level are: mastering skills and using weapons in order to take down enemies.

				Connecting to the Game
			</div>
			
			<p>
				In order to play KinslayerMUD, you must obtain a <a href="http://www.kinslayermud.org/wiki/index.php/Connecting_to_the_game">MUD Client</a>, a piece of software that handles communication between your
				computer and the game server. Most clients are free, and we list several options below:
				
				<ul style="line-height:1.7em; font-size:1.2em;">
					<li><strong><a href="http://www.rasbora.freeserve.co.uk/wintin.htm">WinTin</a></strong>: A very basic, free program. WinTin comes enabled with some basic scripting features.</li>
					<li><strong><a href="http://www.mushclient.com/mushclient/mushclient.htm">MUSHClient</a></strong>: A free client that offers aliases(command abbreviations), triggers(auto response), timer, and scripting.</li>
					<li><strong><a href="http://www.kinslayermud.org/wiki/index.php/Telnet">Telnet</a></strong>: A barebones client that comes preinstalled on most machines.</li>
					<li><strong><a href="http://www.zuggsoft.com/index.php?p=cmud">CMud</a></strong>: CMud is a very popular MUD client, but requires a one-time fee. There is a 30-day free trial offered, however.</li>
				</ul>
				
				After selecting a MUD client, all that is required to connect to the KinslayerMUD game server is to specify the host, `<strong>kinslayermud.org</strong>` and port, `<strong>2222</strong>`.
