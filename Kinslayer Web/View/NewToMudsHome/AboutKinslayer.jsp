	Have you ever found yourself deeply immersed in a great novel, but
	biting your fingers in agitation as you read about the characters
	making mistake after mistake? What if you could live the book, be the
	character, and embark on mystical journeys not possible in this world? <br />
	<br /> If this sounds interesting to you, then my friend, you are in
	the right place. <br /> <br /> KinslayerMUD is a 100% free text-based
	roleplaying game based on Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time series. As
	a character in our world, you can be anything you want. Fancy yourself
	a Darkfriend - so be it. Ever had the desire to play a magic-wielding
	Aes Sedai or a monstrous Trolloc? In this highly immersive, live action
	roleplaying game, all of these are possible. <br /> <br /> There are
	endless things to be done here. Many people come here for the intense
	combat, others to explore the world, and some to enjoy the rich
	roleplay environment that we foster here. <br /> <br /> So what will it
	be? Trolloc? Human? Join us and write your champion's story.
